    "    'Moldova’s unrecognised breakaway region of Transnistria says it wants Moscow to bulk up its small contingent of peacekeepers because of what it called growing security risks, Russia’s state-owned RIA news agency reported. Though Moldova does not allow Russia to deploy new troops in Transnistria, Russia has had hundreds of peacekeepers in the region since a bloody war between pro-Russian separatists and Moldovan government forces after the 1991 Soviet breakup. “As long as Russia’s peacekeeping mission continues, Moldova is constrained in any military plans and preparations against Transnistria,” Leonid Manakov, the region’s envoy to Moscow, was cited as saying by RIA. “Transnistria has repeatedly applied for an increase in the number of Russian peacekeepers … There is such an option, and it is justified in terms of the worsening security risks,” he was quoted as saying. Moldova’s ties with Russia are currently badly strained and have deteriorated rapidly over the course of Moscow’s full-scale invasion of neighbouring Ukraine, which Chisinau has repeatedly condemned.',\n",

Even if the constitution were held to be a Federation and the States regarded qua the Union as sovereign, the power of the Union to legislate in respect of the property situated in the States would remain unrestricted, they held. It shows that the majority judges too believed that it is not incorrect to suggest that States and the Union can be regarded as sovereign together. ',\n",

There is no Constitutional guarantee against alteration of the boundaries of the States. By Article 2 of the Constitution, the Parliament may admit into the Union or establish new States on such terms and conditions as it thinks fit, and by Article 3 the Parliament is by law authorised to form a new State by redistribution of the territory of a State or by uniting two or more States or parts of States or by uniting any territory to a part of any State, increase the area of any State, diminish the area of any State, alter the boundaries of any State, and alter the name of any State',\n",
